Gcode_decoder is :

- Fast and efficient letting you decode gcode
- Allows you also to add custom dictionnarys (the default dictionnary used is Marlin)
- Highlight comments
- and much more...

# Adding custom dictionnarys

1. Creat a dictionnary in .txt format, separe the gcode syntaxe by the redable syntaxe by an equal signe (exemple : gcodesyntaxe = redableforme)
2. Run the programme, enter "custom" in terminal and give the custom dictionnary path (if the dictionnary is in the same path as the main.py file you can just give the name of the file)
3. Run the translate command on the file you want to translate
4. Your translated file is output as translated.txt
